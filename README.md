:star2: [Features](#star2-features) | :compass: [Roadmap](#compass-roadmap) | :scroll: [License](#scroll-license)

Mainframe Notepad app allows you to create JCL jobs or read it from file, edit JCL jobs and send it to mainframe for execution. This app can automatically wait for your job execution and then receive job result status and logs from mainframe. Simple, easy, but powerful.

GUI powered by [DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) project.

:compass: Roadmap
---------------

Personally I found this app very handy in those days when I worked with JCL jobs on a daily basis. Currently I haven't access to the mainframe anymore so right now this project is useless for me but, I hoped, can be useful for someone else.

I'm going to port the Mainframe Notepad to the latest DearPyGui version and freeze it in that state but if you are interested in adding some enhancements or features I am still open to this activity. Just need people with mainframe access who are ready to help with testing.

So feel free to open issues. Pull requests are highly welcomed as well.
